## Description
BAT is a tool for discovering wireless networks, listening on specific wireless networks and performing deauthentication attacks by exploiting a vulnerability in IEEE 802.11 standard.

## IEEE 802.11 Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the IEEE 802.11 standard does not include robust authentication mechanisms for management frames. As a result, an attacker can easily spoof deauthentication frames and send them to a target device, causing disruption to its connection to the Wi-Fi network.

## Deauthentication attack scenario
The attacker sends forged deauthentication frames to the target device, causing it to disconnect from the Wi-Fi network. These deauthentication frames are part of the IEEE 802.11 standard and are used by legitimate network administrators to disconnect devices from a network. However, in a deauthentication attack, the frames are maliciously crafted and sent by an unauthorized party.
