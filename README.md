## ‚öôÔ∏è Requiremets
To use BAT Wireless Tool effectively, it is necessary to have an external compatible Wi-Fi adapter. The tool relies on the ability to interact with Wi-Fi networks, which requires the presence of a functioning Wi-Fi adapter.

## üìù Description
BAT is a tool for discovering wireless networks, listening on specific wireless networks and performing deauthentication attacks by exploiting a vulnerability in IEEE 802.11 standard.

## üõ°Ô∏è IEEE 802.11 Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the IEEE 802.11 standard does not include robust authentication mechanisms for management frames. As a result, an attacker can easily spoof deauthentication frames and send them to a target device, causing disruption to its connection to the Wi-Fi network.
